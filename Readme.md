Grid-Forming (GFM) Inverters

المحتوى

Grid-forming inverters act as voltage sources. They regulate voltage and frequency, making them suitable for weak grids or standalone operation. Unlike grid-following inverters, GFMs don’t rely on the grid to function.

Uses frequency droop control for synchronization
Supports black-start and islanding operation
Provides virtual inertia and fast voltage response
Can operate without synchronous machines
According to Li et al., GFM and GFL inverters are "duals" in terms of synchronization, control, and swing dynamics:contentReference[oaicite:0]0. GFMs manage active power via droop control and show greater resilience in systems with reduced system strength. However, they may need higher current capacity and energy buffers like batteries or supercapacitors

Grid-Following (GFL) Inverters

Grid-following inverters act as current sources. They require a stable voltage signal to synchronize with the grid using a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop). GFLs are commonly used in solar and wind applications where the grid is strong.

Uses PLL for synchronization
Follows voltage and frequency of existing grid
Cannot black start or operate independently
Less costly and more widely deployed
GFLs are more vulnerable to weak grids because of their PLL-based control. They tend to destabilize systems under high penetration or low inertia. While cheaper and easier to deploy, they don't provide the same grid support as GFMs — especially for black start, fault response, or voltage formation.

Key Differences Between GFM and GFL Inverters

المحتوى
While both Grid-Forming (GFM) and Grid-Following (GFL) inverters convert DC to AC power, they operate based on different principles.

1. Role in the Grid

GFM inverters can form the voltage and frequency of the grid, while GFL inverters must follow an existing grid signal.

2. Synchronization

GFM uses droop control to self-synchronize. GFL relies on a PLL to lock onto the grid voltage angle and frequency.

3. Weak Grid Compatibility

GFM can operate in weak or islanded grids. GFL becomes unstable or non-functional if grid strength drops too low.

4. Use Cases

GFM is ideal for microgrids, backup, and black start. GFL is common in grid-connected solar and wind farms.

Droop Control used by GFM Inverters

المحتوى
Droop control is a method used by Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters to regulate frequency and voltage without needing a reference grid signal. It works similarly to how synchronous generators adjust their output in response to changes in power demand.

Controls frequency based on active power: P-ω droop
Controls voltage based on reactive power: Q-V droop
Supports decentralized operation with no communication
Ideal for weak or islanded grid conditions
As explained by Markovic et al., droop-based controllers in GFMs can synchronize multiple units and share power automatically, providing stability and inertia-like behavior in low-inertia systems

Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Used by GFL Inverters

المحتوى
A PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) is used by Grid-Following (GFL) inverters to synchronize their output with the grid. The PLL continuously tracks the phase angle and frequency of the grid voltage and adjusts the inverter output accordingly.

Highly accurate under stable grid conditions
Requires a strong external voltage reference
Vulnerable to instabilities in weak or faulted grids
Common in solar and wind power applications
According to Li et al., PLL-based control introduces time delays and sensitivity to grid impedance, which can destabilize systems during high renewable penetration
